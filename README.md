This project is a clone of YouTube. But the main intention is to show how to write clean code, using proper MVC patterns and re-usable coding methodologies.
It includes features like:
1) Building UICollectionView all from code without using Storyboards
2) Customisable navigation bar to match that of YouTube
3) Creating a custom Menu bar using UICollectionView
4)
