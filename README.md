# YouTubeClone
This project is a clone of YouTube. But the main intention is to show how to write clean code, using proper MVC patterns and re-usable coding methodologies.
It includes features like:
1) Building UICollectionView all from code without using Storyboards
2) Customisable navigation bar to match that of YouTube
3) Creating a custom Menu bar using UICollectionView
4) NSURLSession task to complete a fetch request & iterate through all the objects in this JSON dictionary & construct all video objects
5) Load images Asynchronously
6) Creating a Slide-In Menu
7) Lazy var instantiation explained
8) JSON parsing in most optimised way
9) Play a remote video using AVPlayer inside the app
10) Video player controls like Pause, Play, Progress indicator etc.
